<h1>AI Tetris thing for CS1300, Cal Poly Pomona</h1>
<h2>by Maximum Wilder-Smith</h2>
Feel free to use this code, the actual game thingy is run from the Genetics package, Evolution::main.
Careful with the inputs as they aren't very durable (don't exceed requested values).
If it is outputting, then the output will be saved to your default directory.
